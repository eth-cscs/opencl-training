C++ source code
===============

Code tested on NVIDIA K20x, AMD Opteron, Intel SandyBridge and Xeon Phi with
OpenCL 1.1(NVIDIA) and OpenCL 1.2(all the others) drivers.

On most Linux systems(other than Cray) the OpenCL includes are under 
/usr/include and libOpenCL is in /usr/lib. libOpenCL will use the information
found under /etc/OpenCL to select the requested OpenCL implementation at
run-time. 

Cray XK-7 with CUDA 5 installed
-------------------------------

Compilation:

module load cudatoolkit

g++ ../src/02_create_context.cpp \
  -I/opt/nvidia/cudatoolkit/5.0.35.102/include \
  -L//opt/cray/nvidia/default/lib64 \
  -lOpenCL

Run:

salloc -N1
aprun ./a.out ...

In case the AMD-APP-SDK is installed on the machine it is
possible to access two OpenCL platforms (CPU and GPU) by
loading the AMD-APP-SDK module before running the executable.
